# Image-Processing-Assignment
Image Processing Assignment of MSDSA Faculty

### Some Notes:
- The project tries to avoid built-in functions for image processing as much as it could.
- The project however uses built-in numpy matrix manipulation as much as possible.
- The broadcasting features is used very frequently.
- Any function that can be vectorized is vectorized for efficient computation.
- Images used for testing the functions is given directly in the repo in the Images folder.
- The functions are modularised and their applications are shown in jupyter Notebook.
- The functions works for all grayscale images but only works for some colour images.
